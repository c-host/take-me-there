# Take Me There - iii

## Concept

This path presents users with a series of randomly selected websites, each with a countdown timer. Users must wait through five different sites before reaching their final destination.

## How it Works

1. The script selects a random website from the list of fictional digital interoperability websites
2. A countdown timer is displayed for a random duration (4-8 seconds)
3. This process repeats for a total of 5 websites
4. After visiting all 5 sites, a journey summary is displayed
5. Users can copy their journey details and proceed to the final destination
