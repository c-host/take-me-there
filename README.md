## About

Take Me There is a collection of interactive web experiences that guide users through various paths to reach the "How Did You Find Me" website. Each path in the library offers a unique journey, showcasing different web technologies and creative approaches.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Choose a path to begin your journey

## Library

The `library` directory contains various paths created by contributors. Each path has its own directory with an HTML file and a README explaining its concept and features. Current paths include:

- **Interoperable Institute Initiative (iii)**: A maze of deliberation with randomly selected websites and countdown timers.
- **Crude Future**: A dystopian scenario with collapsing URLs and interfaces.
- **Prototype**: An early version showcasing the development process.

## Creating Your Own Path

1. Use the `template` directory as a starting point for your path
2. Customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create your unique experience
3. Add a README.md file explaining your path's concept and any special features

For detailed instructions, refer to the README.md file in the `template` directory.

## Prompt Logs

The development process for two of our paths, Crude Future (CF) and Interoperable Institute Initiative (III), is documented in prompt logs:

- **cf-prompt-log.md**: This log details the iterative process of creating the Crude Future path. It shows how the concept evolved from a simple collapsing effect to a more complex, dystopian experience with progressive website collapse, rhythmic clapping effects, and haptic-like visual feedback.

- **iii-prompt-log.md**: This log outlines the development of the Interoperable Institute Initiative path. It documents the creation of a journey through random websites with countdown timers, and the implementation of a summary feature for the user's journey.

These logs provide insight into the creative process and can serve as inspiration for contributors looking to create their own unique paths.
